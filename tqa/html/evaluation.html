<H3>Evaluation Criteria</H3>
The submission are evaluated separately on the competition's two subtasks.
<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>
<H4>Text and Diagram Question Answering</H4>
<p>
	For this task, the evaluation server requires a json file to be submitted in the following form:
</p>
<p>
	{
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	"Question_ID": "letter corresponding to answer choice"
</p>
<p>
	}
</p>

<H4>Text only Question Answering</H4>
<p>
	The submission and evaluation guidelines are the same as the full task above. For this task, only performance on
	the text questions is measured. Questions requiring a diagram are not scored, and can be left out of the submission file.
